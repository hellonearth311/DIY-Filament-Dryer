## 10/14/2025 - Began work on the enclosure design  

I just started working on my enclosure design for the filament dryer in Tinkercad. The software is pretty bad and feels childish, so I'm going to switch to using Autodesk Fusion with my education license instead!

As you can see in the image, Tinkercad makes holes super weird, and I hate that so much. (The gray things are holes)
