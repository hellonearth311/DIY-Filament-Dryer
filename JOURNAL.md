## 10/14/2025 - Began work on the enclosure design  

I just started working on my enclosure design for the filament dryer in Tinkercad. The software is pretty bad and feels childish, so I'm going to switch to using Autodesk Fusion with my education license instead!

As you can see in the image, Tinkercad makes holes super weird, and I hate that so much. (The gray things are holes)  

## 10/15/2025 - Suffering in Fusion 360  

I tried to switch to Fusion 360 but this is hell. Everything is so unnecessarily complicated and hidden behind so many menus, so I gave up on that too. I'm going to try OnShape as @dhyan in the Slack recommended for me to. Have a picture of my disgusting Fusion 360 design in the mean time.![screenshot.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjM5NywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--46951937986e0e314e7f1d962636ca42b046bb18/taxfraud.png)
